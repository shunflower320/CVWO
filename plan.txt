Execution plan:

Each search involves looking up multiple tables
Consider prioritising commonly accessed data (do sth to their keys)
Think about relationships between tables (?)

CRUD: create, read, update, delete

Styling: use Vanilla framework

Actual tasks:
1. come up with task manager that allows for CRUD of tasks
2. tasks are to be tagged, which are used for searching
